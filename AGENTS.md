# Agent Instructions

This project uses **br** (Beads Rust) for issue tracking: a SQLite + JSONL store in
`.beads/`, shared by every worktree of this repository. Run `br prime` to get
started, `br robot-docs guide` for the agent-facing reference.

**Never run `bd` (Beads Go/Dolt) against this repository.** It was migrated to `br`
on 2026-10-01; `bd` would create a second, divergent store. The archived bd store and
its verified restore instructions are at
`~/dev-env/beads-archives/chess/README.md`. Precedent: bead `alley-ot7` in the
Alleyoop tracker (costing-comparison bd -> br).

## Quick Reference

```bash
br ready              # Find available work
br show <id>          # View issue details
br update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
br close <id>         # Complete work
br ready --json       # Machine-readable work view for agents
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var
- `br init` - pass `--force`; never let it overwrite a populated store

This repository has a Git remote, `origin`
(`git@github.com:DylanDelliColli/chess-coach.git`, established by the operator on
2026-10-01 after the first four units had merged locally). The release integrates by
**local merge into `release/v1-mvp`**, and the chief pushes that branch after each
merge; the operator merges the accepted release into `master` and tags it. Worker
branches are not pushed before their unit merges.

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_rust](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (`br`/`bd`) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View ready issues (open, unblocked, not deferred)
br ready              # or: bd ready

# List and search
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br search "keyword"   # Full-text search

# Create and update
br create --title="..." --description="..." --type=task --priority=2
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once

# Sync with git
br sync --flush-only  # Export DB to JSONL
br sync --status      # Check sync status
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `br sync --flush-only` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only open, unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers 0-4, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, chore, docs, question
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
git add <files>         # Stage code changes
br sync --flush-only    # Export beads changes to JSONL
git commit -m "..."     # Commit everything
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always sync before ending session
